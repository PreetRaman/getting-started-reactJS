This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# ReactJS Click Target

A simple game built with ReactJS. In this game, random numbers(targets) are displayed on the screen after user clicks "New Game" button. The number is displayed on the screen only for a few seconds and is replaced by another random number. 

When a user clicks on the displayed number, DOM is updated and the clicked number is displayed on the screen. DOM is updated on each successful user click. When the number clicked by user is less than the previous number, Game ends.
